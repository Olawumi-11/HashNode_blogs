# Expressions And Variables in Python

### Python Expressions

Expressions are operations the python performs for example basic arithmetic operations like addition, division and multiplication of multiple numbers. The operation is called operands and the mathematical symbols used are called operators. The addition operations can be performed by summing multiple numbers together.

**Example:**

`2+2+2 = 6`

While the subtraction operation can be performed by using the subtraction sign (-), likewise the multiplication and modulo operation can be performed by using the Asterisk (\*) and modulo (%) operators respectively. The division operation can be performed by either using a single forward slash (/) which result in a floating-point number or a double forward slash (//) which output and integer (whole number) value. Python follows mathematical conventions when performing mathematical operations.

**Example:**

`10+3-6*2`

In the example above, the multiplication is performed first before addition and subtraction and the final result will give 1. Let's take a look at another example.

**Example:**

### Python Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values. There is no command for creating variables in Python. A variable can be created when you assign a value to the variable you are trying to create using the assignment operator (=).

**Example:**

`y = 7`

`x = 6`

We can then go ahead and use the value somewhere else in our code by typing the exact name of the variable. Let's take a look at the examples below.

`y = 10`

In the example above, y is the variable name, the equal sign (=) is the assignment operator and 10 is the variable value. `python x = 2 print(x)`

In the example above, the code will output the value of x which is 2.

In Python, we can reassign values to variables and the old value of the variable will not be useful again. We can also store the result of expressions inside a variable.

**Example:**

```python
6+8+6 = x
  print(x)
```

In the above example, the code output the sum of 5, 8 and 6 and this will be equal to 20. X now stores the result of the expression. We can also perform operations on x and save the result to another variable.

**Example:**

`x + 2 = y`

y now has a new value of 22. Also, we can perform operations on x and assign the value to x.

`x + 5 = x`

The expression above output 25, which is now the new value of x. As before, the old value of x is not important anymore.

### The Type Command

The type() command can be used to check for the data types of individual variables.

**Example:** \`\`\`python x = 2

type(x)

````plaintext

The result of the code above is an integer.

### Casting ###

Casting is done whenever we want to specify the data type of a variable.

**Example:**
```python
x = str(5)     # x will be '3'

y = float(4)   #   y will be 4.0

z = int(2.0)   #   z will be 2
````

String variables can be declared by either using single or double quote.

**Example:**

`x = "Victor"`

`y = 'Victor'`

These two methods of declaring variables in strings are valid and acceptable in Python. However, if you are going to use a single or double quote, make sure you use it to open and close the variable. Using a single and double quote in both expressions will throw an error. The example below is not valid and will throw an error.

**Example:**

```python
name = "Victor'

x = 'monkey"
```

### Case - Sensitivity

Variable names are case insensitive, whether you choose to use capital letters or small letters for your variable name, both are valid in Python. Variable Naming in Python A variable can have a short name like y and z or more descriptive and meaningful name like age,gender and so on.

### Variable Naming in Python

In Python there are certain rules guiding Naming of variables.

**This Rules are listed below.**

1. A variable must start with a letter
    
2. A variable name cannot start with a number.
    
3. A variable name can only contain alpha- numeric characters and underscores (A-Z, 0-9 and \_).
    
4. Variable names are case insensitive.
    

**Examples of legal variable names in python**

```python
Age = 40

age = 30

_price = 10.0

my_price_2 = 40

my name = "Mary"

MYCAR = "Toyota"

_price_at_pump = 15.6
```

**Illegal Variable Name Examples**

```python
2mycar = "Tesla" # variable name cannot start with a number

My name = "Funky" # variable name cannot contain white space

my-name = "James" # variable name cannot contain special characters.
```

### Multi Words Variable Names

**Variables With Multi Words**

There are several techniques we can use to write multi words variables. The techniques are listed below.

**Camel Case**

In this technique, each word except the first starts with a capital letter e.g myThirdName = "Olawumi"

**Pascal Case** In this multi words variable technique, each word starts with a capital letter. MyThirdName = "Olawumi"

**Snake Case** In this technique, each word is separated by an underscore. my\_third\_name = "Olawumi"

### Assigning Multiple Values to Variables

#### Many Values to Multiple Variables.

In python, you can assign values to multiple variables in a single line, and you can also assign the same value to multiple variables.

**Example:** \`\`\`python

x,y,z = "Taiwo", "Kenny", "Idowu"

print(x) # x will output Taiwo

print(y) # y will output Kenny

print(z) # z will output Idowu \`\`\`

#### A single value to multiple variables.

We can also assign a single value to multiple variables

**Example:**

```python

x=y=z ="Tayo"

print(x) x will output Tayo

print(y) y will output Tayo

print(z) z will output Tayo
```

### Unpacking a collection in python

If you have values in one of the python built in data types, such as list,tuple, dictionary or set, you can extract the values into variables. This Phenomenon is called Unpacking.

**Example:** \`\`\`python

Names = ("Best", "Peter", "Paul")

x,y,z = Names

print(x) print(y) print(z) \`\`\`

In the example above, we unpack the items in the tuple and store them in the variables x,y and z respectively.

### Local and Global Variables

#### Global Variables

Global Variables are variables that are created outside a function. All the variable examples I have cited above are global. These variables can be used by everyone both inside and outside of functions. In the example below, I am going to create a global variable and used it inside and outside a function.

```python
x = "Princess"
def About():
   print(x + " is a graduate of 
   Stanford University")


About()
print(x + " is a female")
```

In the example above, the variable x was used inside the about function and also outside the function. These variable types are called "Global" and like I said before, they can be used both inside and outside of a function.

#### Local Variables

Local Variable are Variables that are declared inside a function and can only be used inside the function i.e they are local to the function. Consider the example below.

```python
def Marketprice():
    y = 5.0
    print("The current market 
                price is " + y)


Marketprice()
print(y + " is the current market price ")
```

In the code above, the function call will return *The current market price is 5* while the second line of code will output an **error** and the reason is because y is a local Variable, and it cannot be used outside of the function. Let's take a look at another example.

In this example, I am going to create a variable inside a function with the same name as the global variable.

```python
x = "sweet"

def Myhubby():
   x = " Stubborn"
   print("my hubby is " + x)

Myhubby()
print("python is " + x)
```

The function call will print **my hubby is stubborn** i.e it uses the local Variable x in the function. The second line of code prints **python is sweet** i.e it uses the global variable x.

### The Global Keyword

To create a global variable inside a function, the global keyword can be used to initiate the variable. Take a look at the example below

**Example:**

```python
def myfunc():
    global x 
    x = "fantastic"

myfunc()
print("python is " + x)
```

Because the variable inside the function was initiated with the global keyword, the variable is no longer local but global and it can be used both inside and outside of the function. Therefore, the function call will output **fantastic** while the second line of code will output **python is fantastic**.
